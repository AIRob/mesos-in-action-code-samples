This repository contains supplementary code for the book "Mesos in Action",
written by Roger Ignazio and published by Manning Publications.

## How this repository is organized
In this repo, I've organized specific code samples into directories based on
the chapters and appendices in the book. Each directory contains its own README
which provides additional details about how to use each of the files contained
within.

In a few cases, there are some examples that aren't organized by chapter. These
include:

  * keys-values-app
  * output-env-app
  * wordcount-example
  * email-weather-forecast.py

These examples are included at the top level of this repository because they
are, or can be, used with topics and projects covered in multiple chapters.
